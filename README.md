I made this game out of boredom in one night using Unity3d. It's a combination
of the famous [helicopter game](http://www.helicoptergame.net/) and the
ROFLcopter internet meme.

The signal pattern code from the Unity Patterns website was used for the GUI
button click events.

The theme song was downloaded from opengameart.org and is made by the user
deadEarth.
